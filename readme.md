<h1>Malware Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network</h1>
This represents the projects for my Mathematics and Computer Science Bachelor's Degree.

I have implemented and trained an Inception Module based CNN, and got 98% accuracy and 9% loss, on a modified Malimg dataset (I have also added a Benign class). The .h5 model was integrated in a Desktop application, and thus an "anti-virus" kind of program was created.   

The repo contains the following: 
<ul>
    <li>The Colab Notebook of my CNN network implementation and training</li>
    <li>A few helper python scripts</li>
    <li>Desktop Application UI code (Electron.js)</li>
</ul>
